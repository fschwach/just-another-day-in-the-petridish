## Use the code

open the file main.ts in [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
and download from there onto a microbit.

To fully try the activity, you will need at least two microbits, one to serve as the player and one as a
food or antibiotic source. Ideally, you will want three devices.

When the code is loaded onto the device, an animation of arrows will be shown to prompt for pressing of either the A button, B button or A+B at the same time. 
A: turn device into food source
B: turn device into player
A+B: turn device into antibiotic source

In player mode, you first need to calibrate the compass by tilting and moving the microbit until
the LED matrix is all lit up. This sometimes takes more than one round of calibrating.

The game status is displayed on the built-in LED matrix:

row1 = score
row2 = food signal strength
row3 = antib iotic signal strength
row4 = plasmids obtained ( LED1 = food utlisation, LED2 = antibiotic resistance)
row5 = direction: middle LED means "go straight", LEDs to the left or right mean turn left or right
